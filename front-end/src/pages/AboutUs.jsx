        <p>
          Postery is a Swedish brand bringing you carefully created and unique
          art prints. We are a curious and creative team based in Gothenburg,
          Sweden, and we believe in diversity, value and quality. We are united
          by our love for art, and we are passionate about trends, interiors and
          design that help create that personal space. We enjoy the aesthetics
          of the world, and we invite everyone to join and contribute – to
          explore the beauty of art and design. As the future is sustainable, we
          make sure that our products are made to last and inspire for a long
          time. With a focus on craftsmanship and rooted in the Scandinavian
          design heritage, our posters, frames, and hangers are being
          thoughtfully made to stand as staples of a modern home.

        <h4>OUR PURPOSE</h4>
        <p>
          Our purpose is to create and offer high quality, premium products and
          make them accessible globally. We design and offer everyone beautiful,
          well-crafted items. Our mission is to bring joy to each home in the
          world and make people feel at home – we believe that “Home is where
          the art is”. We want to inspire and share our passion for the arts. We
          are determined to do so in respect of mother nature and make it our
          legacy to minimise the impact on the environment and support the
          workers in the whole production chain.
